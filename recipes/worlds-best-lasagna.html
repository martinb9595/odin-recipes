      these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:
    </p>

        cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>

    <h3>How to Layer Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
      The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but
      this is the order you'll follow:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Meat sauce</li>
      <li>Noodles</li>
      <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
      <li>Mozzarella slices</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
      The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
      to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
      you cut into it.
