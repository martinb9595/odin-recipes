    <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.

    <h2>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade
      lasagna recipe:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat</strong>This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground
        meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion</strong>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the
        ground meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Canned Tomatoes</strong>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a
        can of crushed tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh herbs</strong>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of
        parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar</strong>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity
        from the tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>This homemade lasagna is seasoned
        with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Noodles</strong>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This
        recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready
        variety to save time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese</strong>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and
        Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs</strong>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they
        act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full,
      step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can
      expect:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the meat:</strong>Cook the ground meat in a skillet until
        browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's
        translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley,
        garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the noodles: </strong>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly
        salted water until they're al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the cheese layer:</strong>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan
        cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong>Layer the ingredients according to
        the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the
        lasagna is assembled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong>Cover with foil and bake in the
        preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue
        baking until the top is golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
      In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be
      perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes
      uncovered).
